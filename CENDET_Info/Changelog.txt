    This code plots properly with no duplicates with the following exceptions.
    Plots 2+ state for 65Zn - problem not found yet.

    Updated README.md with how the program now works
    Added a mass parabola function
    Updated plotting so uncertainty is shown in bar width


Version UPDATE 0.5.0 06-16-2017 1400MT -W. McDonald and M.S. Martin:
    dataClass.py rewritten to find ALL spin states.
    Ensdf reading algorithm redone to match how the data files are organized.
    Removed any manual error/exception handling - reading data will no longer generate errors.
    Added functions to retrieve beta decay Q values from nuclear chart.
    Cleaned up plotting for error bars.
