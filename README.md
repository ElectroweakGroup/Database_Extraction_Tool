# Database_Extraction_Tool


### Outline of Program
The end goal of the project is to create a cohesive and intuitive set of GUIs which can be used to effectively sort through large databases for nuclear structural data and atomic binding data. This will allow for an easy, systematic study of excited nuclear states, atomic mass data, and beta decay transitions.

This program has 3 functions: 
1. Produce plots of nuclear states requested by the user.
2. Return an array of relevant atomic mass data.
3. Produce plots of nuclear states with beta decay data.



### How to run this program:
1. Run the `USE_THIS.py` script.
2. Click on the desired function. 
3. Input appropriate values and select options necessary before hitting the appropriate submit button.
4. Requested plots will appear in the GUI when it reopens, and actual data can be found in the `Outputs/gnuPlot` directory.



### How this program operates:
There are several scripts which interact with each other to produce the plots and outputs, When the user runs `USE_THIS.py`, a GUI opens asking which subsequent program to run. Each of these programs runs independently. 

The first program calls `isotopeDataExportingDat.py` and allows for a significant number of inputs, allowing the user to access a larger range of data with more customizability. This program collects desired data from ensdf.xxx data files as well as mass16.txt files and plots the desired output. All data is saved to the `Output/gnuPlot` file, with plots being saved as .png.

The second command executed runs the `pltFileExp` function from the `isotopeDataExportingDat.py` script. The `pltFileExp` function reads the text files generated by the first command and produces a single gnuPlot using data from all the text files generated.

The third button runs as the first one does, but with a limited set of options and pre-set commands built in to call additional isotopes for the different types of Beta decay.



### What happens when I click 'Submit'?
When the user clicks any of the submit buttons, the input values are sent to the rest of the program which allows the data to be extracted from the files and plotted.
