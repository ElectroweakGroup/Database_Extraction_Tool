# Database_Extraction_Tool

Outline of Program
    The end goal of the project is to create a cohesive and intuitive GUI which
    can be used to effectively sort through two large databases for nuclear
    structural data and atomic binding data. This GUI will plot the data
    obtained from the two databases and allow for the user to study properties
    of excited nuclei more systematically.

    Updated README.md file to include project description.
    Created a way for the program to interpret blank entries into the left side
    of the GUI. Now some blank entries will kill the program while some will
    set to default values
